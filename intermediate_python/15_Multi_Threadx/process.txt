Process: an instance of a program (firefox, vlc, chrome)

+ Takes advantage of multiple CPUs and cores
+ Sperate memory space -> Memory is not shared amongs processes
+ Great for CPU bound Tasks
+ New process is started independently from other processes
+ Processes are interuptible/killable
+ One GIL for each process -> Avoid GIL limitations

- Heaviwieght
- Sarting a process is slower than starting a thread
- More memory
- IPC (inter-process communication) is more complicated
