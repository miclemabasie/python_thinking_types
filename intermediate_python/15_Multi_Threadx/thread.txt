Threads: An entity within a process that can be scheduled for execution (also known as a lightwieght procss)

A thread process can spawn multiple threads

+ All threads within a process share the same memory
+ Lightwieght
+ Starting a thread is fater than starting a process
+ Great for I/O bound task

- Threading is limited by the GIL: only one thread can be ran at a time in python
- No effect fo CPU bound task
- Not interuptible or killable
- Careful with race conditions
